# SDK-CSharp

C# SDK for interacting with TokenOS.

Account linking and notification features are currently not supported.

## Requirements

### On Windows

There are no prerequisites for Windows.

### On Linux and OSX

1. Install `Mono` from [here](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

    `Mono` is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework. It brings the .NET framework to non-Windows envrionments like Linux and OSX.

2. Install `libsodium` library.

    [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) is a cross-platform crypto library written in C. The SDK uses a wrapper of the library for `Ed25519` signature generation and verification. 

    **For OSX**:

        brew install libsodium

    **For Linux**:

        sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev

    For more information, see [here](https://github.com/adamcaudill/libsodium-net).

## Build

Follow the steps above, make sure you have `ruby` and `curl` installed.

To build the SDK and run tests:

        ./build.sh
        
## Using the SDK

To use the SDK, add the [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Token.SDK.Net/) package as a dependency to your project file:

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;ItemGroup>
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Token.SDK.Net" Version="1.0.8" />
&lt;/ItemGroup>
</pre></div>
